Project title: "Determining the stress-strain curve of aluminium using an indendation test"

To be used with CalculiX 2.11 (with GraphiX). 

*.fbd files are cgx scripts, used to generate the geometry and mesh, and to easily view the results in cgx.

mrn.py the primary script for running simulations.
